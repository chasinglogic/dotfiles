When branching from master or stable must use one of the type
indicating flags. Otherwise the new branch name will be derived from
the current branch.

The description can contain spaces but they will be sanitized into "-"
characters.

Examples:
  (from master or stable) branch -b SYS-123 fix model inconsistency in product => bug/SYS-123/fix-model-inconsistency-in-product
  (from bug/SYS-123/fix-model-inconsistency-in-product) branch -b SYS-124 remove inconsistent field from product => bug/SYS-123/SYS-124/remove-inconsistent-field-from-product

Note that when branching from an existing MPB branch the previous
description will be stripped off if present.

Options:
  -y BRANCH_TYPE  Manually set the branch type to BRANCH_TYPE

  -e  Indicates this is for an epic
  -f  Indicates this is feature work
  -t  Indicates this is a task issue type
  -b  Indicates this is a bug issue type
  -r  Indicates this is a release branch

  -d  Do a dry-run (print the name of the branch generated instead of doing the branching)"
    exit 0
